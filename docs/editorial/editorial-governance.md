## 3. Content Workflow Stages

All content passes through the following stages, tracked via the `status` field in article frontmatter.

```text
┌────────┐    ┌───────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌───────────┐
│ draft  │───►│ in-review │───►│ advisor-review   │───►│ approved │───►│ published │
└────────┘    └───────────┘    │ (high-risk only) │    └──────────┘    └───────────┘
     ▲              │           └──────────────────┘         │
     │              │                                        │
     └──────────────┘ (revision requested)          ┌────────▼────────┐
                                                     │    archived     │
                                                     └─────────────────┘
```

> **Formal transitions:** the allowed status transitions (including `published → in-review` for
> updates, `published → archived` and `published → retracted`) and the rule that approved/published
> content is frozen are defined in [`content-lifecycle.md`](content-lifecycle.md) §2a and enforced
> by `scripts/validation/check-status-transitions.py`.

## 4. Quality Standards

### 4.1 Medical Accuracy

- All clinical claims must be supported by at least one of: peer-reviewed publication (PMID), named clinical guideline (AWMF, ESC, DGK, DGN, etc.), or textbook reference with edition and page number.
- Unsupported statements, speculation, and anecdote are not permitted.
- Drug dosing information requires a secondary pharmacological reference cross-check.

### 4.2 Currency

- Articles must reflect the most current available evidence and guidelines.
- A "last reviewed" date is mandatory in frontmatter.
- Articles not reviewed within **12 months** of publication are flagged as `stale` by automated tooling.
- Articles referencing guidelines that have been superseded must be updated within **30 days** of guideline publication.

### 4.3 Language and Readability

- Professional articles: written in clear medical German, targeting a physician/healthcare professional audience.
- Patient articles: written at a maximum *Leichte Sprache* B2 level; jargon must be explained or avoided.
- No colloquialisms or ambiguous language in clinical instruction sections.

### 4.4 Structural Completeness

Professional articles must include all mandatory sections as defined in `content/templates/article-professional.md`. Patient articles must follow `content/templates/article-patient.md`. Missing mandatory sections block publication.

---

## 5. Conflict of Interest Policy

- All contributors, reviewers, and editors must declare conflicts of interest (financial relationships with pharmaceutical companies, device manufacturers, or other commercial entities) at the time of author application and update their declaration annually.
- Declarations are stored in the author registry (Nextcloud, access-controlled).
- A contributor with a declared conflict in the product or therapy covered by an article **may not serve as the sole author or sole reviewer** for that article.
- Undisclosed conflicts of interest discovered post-publication result in article retraction pending re-review.

---

## 6. Corrections Policy

### Minor Corrections

Typographical errors, formatting issues, and non-clinical corrections may be corrected by Editors without triggering a full review cycle. A `patch` version bump is applied.

### Substantive Corrections

Changes to clinical content, diagnoses, dosing, or therapeutic recommendations require a new peer review cycle. A `minor` or `major` version bump is applied depending on scope.

### Post-Publication Corrections

A correction notice is appended to the article frontmatter and displayed on the published page. The nature of the correction and the date are recorded.

## 7. AI Usage Policy

> **The authoritative policy is [`ai-assistance-policy.md`](ai-assistance-policy.md)** (v1.0,
> 2026-10-09). The summary below is kept for orientation; where it differs, the policy document wins.
> New in the policy: `ai_assistance_description` is mandatory when `ai_assisted: true`, the validator
> enforces the declaration, and no AI is part of the publishing pipeline.

### Permitted Uses

- AI-assisted drafting (e.g., GPT-based tools) for initial structuring, outline generation, or language polishing.
- AI-assisted PubMed abstract screening (relevance classification in `scripts/pubmed/`).
- AI-assisted translation between languages (requires full human medical review of the translated output).

### Mandatory Declarations

- Any article where AI tools contributed substantially to the initial draft must declare this in the YAML frontmatter field `ai_assisted: true`.
- AI-generated content is **not** publishable without full human review and revision by a qualified author.
- AI tools may **not** be used to generate reference lists, PMID citations, or guideline references — these must be manually verified.

### Prohibited Uses

- Using AI to fabricate or invent clinical data, study results, or statistics.
- Using AI to generate drug dosing information without cross-checking against a pharmacological reference.
- Using AI-generated content as a substitute for peer review.
